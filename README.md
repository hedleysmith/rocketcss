Rocket CSS
----------

A decoupled library of CSS components written using Sass.

Components are provided with some styling and configuration options but are designed to be used as a starting point in a custom design system.

Rocket also encourages the use of components from other libraries.

### Customising Components

It's up to you how you customise the components. Here are two suggested approaches

1) __Use Rocket components as a starting point.__ Go in and edit the component code directly, useful for larger projects where you're likely to deviate significantly from the original component and you want to have more control. A disadvantage of this is that if there are updates released for a component it'll be more difficult to take advantages of these.

2) __Configure and extend components.__ By keeping the original Rocket component you'll be able to take advantage of any updates that are released. Each component has a number of default configuration options documented at the start of the component file, these can be overridden elsewhere in the codebase. You could add your own customisations to a _theme.scss file which should be included before the component.

## Importing Components

With numerous front end component libraries out there it makes sense to harness them. Rocket provides a way to use and customise individual components from other libraries without having to follow their design patterns entirely.
